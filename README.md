# Overview

To further my learning, i have taken up the task to learn some kotlin. kotlin is an etirely different language than what I have been used to writing. to further my understanding, I decided to branch out and make a calculator app using this different language to prove that I can learn a new language if needed.

I decided to design a simple Kotlin application. it runs in the terminal. its a calculator with a simple design using multipulcation, addition, subtraction, and division.

My purpose for building this is because i have built calulators in other languages but they were languages that I was familiar with. now that I am writing in a langauge that i am not familiar with.

# Development Environment

I used a kotlin extension, vscode and some of the kotlin documentation. I also was required to download java for this specific language.

I used kotlin which is a programming language usually used for making apps or programs for devices. the library that I imported is: import java.util.Scanner, which helps me import scanner. scanner helps me read the keys that the user types.

# Future Work

- Item 1: Clear display
- Item 2: app display for android -> then IOS
- Item 3: Error handling -> resets the calculator if puts in string or anything other than number.
